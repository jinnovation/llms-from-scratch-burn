# Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch): Rust/Burn Edition

Code for Sebastian Raschka's phenomenal ["Build a Large Language Model (From
Scratch)"](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch), implemented in
Rust using [Burn](https://burn.dev/).

> [!TIP]
> See also: [`nerdai/llms-from-scratch-rs`](https://github.com/nerdai/llms-from-scratch-rs), which
> does this exercise using [Candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) instead of Burn.
